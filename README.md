| Zenroom Transaction Processor for Hyperledger Sawtooth |
:---:
| [![Dyne.org](https://img.shields.io/badge/%3C%2F%3E%20with%20%E2%9D%A4%20by-Dyne.org-blue.svg)](https://dyne.org) |


This repository integrates the [Zenroom VM](https://zenroom.dyne.org) to be used as a transaction processor in the [Sawtooth](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/) blockchain distributed by the Linux Foundation's [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/) consortium.

To facilitate the creation of transaction families based on Zenroom and the [Zencode human-friendly language for smart-contracts](https://decodeproject.eu/blog/smart-contracts-english-speaker), this TP uses the [Sawtooth SDK](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/sdks.html) in Python and the [zenroom-py](https://github.com/DECODEproject/zenroom-py) bindings.

## :play-button: Bash

We have included a bash script `xec.sh` which automates some common commands you might want to run.

### Pre-requisites (OSX)

```
brew install automake pkg-config libtool libffi gmp
python3 ./setup.py install
```

You will need an osx build of the zenroom-py module. Assuming you have checked out and built zenroom-py in the same top-levele dir as this repo...

```
. ./.sawtooth-tp.venv/bin/activate
pip uninstall zenroom
pip install ../zenroom-py/dist/zenroom-0.1.3.tar.gz 

```


To get started

```
./xec.sh install
```

This will create an alias so you only need to type `xec` from now on.

```bash
xec init
xec up
xec petition
```

This will initialise the docker compose file and build a local docker image for the zenroom transaction processor. It then brings up 
the set of services we need, which are:

| docker-compose service | Container name         | purpose |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ------- |
| validator              | sawtooth-validator     | Main "node" of the blockchain which executes and validates transactions |
| zenroom-tp             | zenroom-tp             | The transaction processor that executes zencode
| rest-api               | rest-api               | Provides a http / json adaptor over the zeromq protocol to allow clients to talk to the validator from within and also from the host machine|
| shell                  | sawtooth-shell-default | Provides a container with various commands in it which allows you to connect to the rest api from within the docker network | 
| settings-tp            | settings-tp            | A standard transaction processor that allows settings to be configured in the blockchainsd

The key ones are the validator, the rest-api and the zenroom-tp.

The rest-api allows us too communicate with the validator inside the docker netowrk from our host.

The `xec petition` runs a python script called `scripts/execute_petition.py` which runs through all the steps needed to create and sign a petition.

It basically makes calls to the rest api, which can be found on `http:/localhost:8090/`



## :whale: Docker

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

To run a transaction

```bash
docker exec -it zenroom-tp zenroom-tx
```

## :wrench: Configuration
dotenv used the only config is `ZTP_VALIDATOR_ENDPOINT`
