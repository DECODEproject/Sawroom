| Zenroom Transaction Processor for Hyperledger Sawtooth |
:---:
| [![Dyne.org](https://img.shields.io/badge/%3C%2F%3E%20with%20%E2%9D%A4%20by-Dyne.org-blue.svg)](https://dyne.org) |


This repository integrates the [Zenroom VM](https://zenroom.dyne.org) to be used as a transaction processor in the [Sawtooth](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/) blockchain distributed by the Linux Foundation's [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/) consortium.

To facilitate the creation of transaction families based on Zenroom and the [Zencode human-friendly language for smart-contracts](https://decodeproject.eu/blog/smart-contracts-english-speaker), this TP uses the [Sawtooth SDK](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/sdks.html) in Python and the [zenroom-py](https://github.com/DECODEproject/zenroom-py) bindings.
